Welcome to my personal page!

I'm Vardan Barsegyan, a quantitative social scientist in political inequality, social inequality, and mobility, including voluntary and forced migration. I am analyzing survey and administrative data in R, STATA, and Mplus. 

I'm currently working as a [scientific researcher](https://www.wodc.nl/over-het-wodc/organisatie/medewerkers/vardan-barsegyan) at the Research and Documentation Centre (in Dutch: Het Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek- en Documentatiecentrum - WODC) - the knowledge centre of the Dutch Ministry of Justice and Security. In 2019-2023, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the [department of sociology at Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/sociology) (Utrecht, the Netherlands).

I have been living in the Netherlands since 2016, studied and grew up in Russia, and was born in Armenia in 1990. 


My research interests
======
I am curious about how social inequality translates into political inequality. More particularly, how political participation of people is shaped by their social origin, income, education, and occupational status. 

I am also interested in how educational outcomes of students are shaped by their cognitive ability, social (family) origin, and their interplay. For example, I study differences in educational outcomes of first-generation students and continuous-generation students.

Finally, voluntary and forced migration studies form another core component of my research interests. I am studying the causes and consequences of (in)voluntary migration both for the origin and for the host societies.   

I mostly use survey and administrative data, including twin-data. I apply a wide range of quantitative methods including structural equation modeling, latent variable analysis, longitudinal, panel, and multilevel analysis, and behavioral genetic methods.
