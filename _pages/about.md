Welcome to my personal page! 

I'm Vardan Barsegyan, a quantitative social scientist in political and educational inequality, analyzing survey and administrative data in R, STATA, and Mplus. 

I'm currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the [department of sociology at Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/sociology) (Utrecht, the Netherlands).

I was born in Armenia in 1990, grew up in Russia, living in the Netherlands since 2016.


My research interests
======
My main area of interest is political and social inequality. Currently I am working on two projects. 

The first project is about how social inequality translates into political inequality. More particularly, how political participation of people is shaped by their social origin, income, education, and occupational status. 

The second project is about how educational outcomes of students are shaped by their cognitive ability, social (family) origin, and their interplay. For example, I study differences in educational outcomes of first-generation students and continuous-generation students.

I mostly use survey and administrative data, including twin-data. I apply a wide range of quantitative methods including structural equation modeling, latent variable analysis, longitudinal, panel, and multilevel analysis, and behavioral genetic methods.
