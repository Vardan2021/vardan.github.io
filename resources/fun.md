["The Classics"](https://github.com/vardanbarsegyan/vardanbarsegyan.github.io/raw/master/files/the_classics_231215.xlsx) - a list of classical authors of social sciences and humanities in a schronological order with a very short description of their contributions. I created this list in 2015 while being a PhD student. I just updated the list and published on my personal site.
