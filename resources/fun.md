1. ["The Classics"](https://github.com/vardanbarsegyan/vardanbarsegyan.github.io/raw/master/files/the_classics_231215.xlsx) - A list of classical authors in the social sciences and humanities, arranged in chronological order, with very short descriptions of their contributions. I created this list in 2015 while I was a PhD student. I have just updated the list and published it on my personal site.
